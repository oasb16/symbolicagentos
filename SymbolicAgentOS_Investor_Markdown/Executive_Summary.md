Symbolic Agent OS — Executive Summary

Symbolic Agent OS is a project-agnostic, token-optimized orchestration layer that transforms GPT threads into multi-agent symbolic systems. 
With deterministic modularity, recursive prompt validation, and event-driven collaboration, it represents a paradigm shift beyond traditional chatbot architectures.

Why Now:
- The AI Agent market is projected to grow from $5.4B (2024) to $50.3B (2030) with a CAGR of 45.8%.
- 85% of enterprises will use agent-based automation by 2026.
- Major players (AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI) are siloed. Symbolic Agent OS is general-purpose and stackable.

Differentiators:
✓ Recursive prompt compliance engine
✓ Dynamic symbolic role-switching
✓ Sandbox-based secure execution
✓ Human-in-the-loop & cross-agent validation
