# 🧭 Symbolic Agent OS — Naming Convergence Strategy

## 1. Core Branding Principle
We are not building a product, we are defining a **protocol**.

### Naming Goal:
- Communicate symbolic reasoning + agent control
- Resonate with both technical and VC audiences
- Be foundational, not trendy

## 2. Primary Naming Anchors
| Term      | Justification                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic** | Refers to deterministic, auditable systems |
| **Agent**    | Emphasizes autonomous worker paradigm      |
| **OS**       | Signals architecture-level control layer   |

✅ This positions us as the **“Operating System for GPT-native Multi-Agent Systems.”**

## 3. Cross-Domain Fit
- Legal: “Symbolic validation trail”
- Finance: “Audit trail for AI decision-making”
- Infra: “Agent kernel with state control”

## 4. Naming Alternatives
| Candidate         | Positioning                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Symbolic Agent OS| Core convergence term                     |
| AOK (Agent OS Kernel) | Short-form, technical founder-friendly   |
| AxOS (Agent Execution OS) | Marketable as execution-compliant AI infra |
| GPTKernel         | Feels close to OpenAI, less brand-ownable |

## 5. Tagline Suggestions
- "Architect the Agent Future"
- "Auditable AI, Symbolically Controlled"
- "Orchestrate. Validate. Scale."
