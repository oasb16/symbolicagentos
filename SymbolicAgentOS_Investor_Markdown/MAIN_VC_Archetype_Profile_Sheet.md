## 3. Red Flags to Avoid
- VCs only funding surface apps or chatbots
- Non-technical funds chasing LLM trends without architectural depth
- Funds that slow down roadmap with compliance overhead

## 4. Strategy
- Pitch the **v6â€“v7 leap**: this is where validation, kernel control, and token economics converge
- Offer **Protocol Royalty Model** for infra VCs
- Showcase ZIP + Manifesto + Artifact to accelerate conviction
